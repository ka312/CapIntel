## Risk Assessment
1.  What is the difference between a "suspect" and an "accused"?

A suspect is someone who is being investigated for a crime, but has not yet been formally charged. An accused person, on the other hand, has been formally charged with a crime by law enforcement or a prosecutor.

2.  What is the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony?

A misdemeanor is a less serious criminal offense, typically punishable by up to one year in jail. A felony is a more serious criminal offense, typically punishable by more than one year in prison.

3.  What is the difference between a plea bargain and a trial?

A plea bargain is an agreement between a defendant and the prosecutor where the defendant pleads guilty to a lesser charge or agrees to a sentence in exchange for not going to trial. A trial, on the other hand, is a formal proceeding where a judge or jury hears evidence and makes a determination of guilt or innocence based on that evidence.

4.  What is the difference between a bench trial and a jury trial?

In a bench trial, a judge hears the evidence and makes a decision about the defendant's guilt or innocence without a jury. In a jury trial, a group of jurors hear the evidence and make a decision about the defendant's guilt or innocence based on that evidence.

5.  What is the difference between a civil lawsuit and a criminal case?

A civil lawsuit is a dispute between two parties over money or property, while a criminal case is a proceeding brought by the government to punish someone for breaking the law. In a civil lawsuit, the goal is to compensate one party for harm caused by the other; in a criminal case, the goal is to punish the defendant and deter others from committing similar crimes.

6.  What is the difference between a grand jury and a petit jury?

A grand jury is a group of citizens who hear evidence presented by a prosecutor to determine whether there is enough evidence to bring criminal charges against a suspect. A petit jury, on the other hand, is a group of citizens who hear evidence in a trial and make a decision about the defendant's guilt or innocence.

7.  What is the difference between a subpoena and a warrant?

A subpoena is a court order that requires someone to appear in court or produce documents for a legal proceeding. A warrant, on the other hand, is a court order authorizing law enforcement to search a person or place, make an arrest, or seize property.

8.  What is the difference between bail and bond?

Bail is a sum of money that a defendant must pay in order to be released from jail before their trial. A bond is a promise made by someone (usually a friend or family member) to pay the full amount of bail if the defendant fails to appear for their court date.

9.  What is the difference between a probation officer and a parole officer?

A probation officer supervises defendants who have been placed on probation instead of being sentenced to jail or prison. A parole officer supervises prisoners who have been released from prison on parole, which is a conditional release from prison that allows the prisoner to serve the remainder of their sentence in the community under certain conditions.

10.  What is the difference between a statute of limitations and an indictment?

A statute of limitations is a law that sets a time limit on how long prosecutors have to bring charges against someone for a crime. An indictment is a formal accusation by a grand jury that there is enough evidence to bring criminal charges against a suspect.
