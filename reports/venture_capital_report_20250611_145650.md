## Market Analysis
1.  What is the difference between a "class" and an "object"?

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that an object of that class will have. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It's a specific realization of the class, with its own unique values for the properties defined in the class.

For example, if we have a class "Car", it might have properties like "color", "model", and "year", and methods like "startEngine" and "accelerate". When we create an object of this class, say "myCar", it will have its own specific values for these properties (e.g., myCar.color = "red", myCar.model = "Tesla Model S", etc.), and it can call the methods defined in the Car class (e.g., myCar.startEngine(), myCar.accelerate()).

2.  What is inheritance in object-oriented programming?

Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another. The class that inherits is called the subclass or derived class, while the class being inherited from is called the superclass or base class.

For example, if we have a superclass "Vehicle" with properties like "color" and methods like "drive", we can create a subclass "Car" that inherits these properties and methods. The Car class can also have its own unique properties and methods. This way, the Car object will have all the properties and behaviors of a Vehicle (e.g., it can be driven), as well as any additional properties and behaviors specific to Cars (e.g., it has four wheels).

3.  What is polymorphism in object-oriented programming?

Polymorphism is a principle in object-oriented programming that allows one entity to take on many forms. In other words, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were instances of the same class. This can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The subclass's implementation takes precedence over the superclass's implementation when the method is called on an object of the subclass. This allows us to customize the behavior of objects based on their specific type, while still maintaining a consistent interface.

Method overloading, on the other hand, occurs when a class defines multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This allows us to call the correct method based on the number and types of arguments passed.

4.  What is encapsulation in object-oriented programming?

Encapsulation is a principle in object-oriented programming that focuses on hiding the internal details and complexities of an object, and exposing only its essential features to the outside world. This is achieved by defining access levels for properties and methods, such as public, private, and protected.

For example, if we have a class "BankAccount", we might want to keep the account balance private, so that it can't be directly accessed or modified from outside the class. Instead, we provide public methods like "deposit" and "withdraw" that allow users to interact with the account in a controlled way. This not only protects the integrity of the data, but also makes the code easier to manage and maintain.

5.  What is abstraction in object-oriented programming?

Abstraction is a principle in object-oriented programming that focuses on representing complex systems or concepts in simpler terms. It involves identifying the essential features of an object or system, and ignoring the details that are not relevant to the user's needs. This is achieved by defining abstract classes and interfaces, which provide a blueprint for creating objects without specifying their exact implementation.

For example, if we have a complex financial system with many different types of accounts (checking, savings, credit card, etc.), we can create an abstract class "Account" that defines the common properties and behaviors shared by all account types. Each specific account type (e.g., CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount) would then inherit from this abstract class and provide its own implementation for any account-specific features. This way, users only need to interact with the Account interface, without needing to understand the complexities of each individual account type.
